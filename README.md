# Hi, I'm Bastian 👋 👨🏻‍💻

[![Banner](./assets/welcome.png)](#)

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about driving the digital transformation,
creating convincing solutions and building solid, sustainable software.
Some technologies I enjoy working with include PHP, Go and Amazon Web Services. 
I recently started to explore Flutter and Dart for app development.

I spend most of my time working on closed-source projects as a freelancer. Nevertheless, I
try to get deeper into open-source projects from time to time. You can explore
some results of this effort on my Github profile.
