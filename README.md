# Hi, I'm Bastian 👋 👨🏻‍💻

![As a software engineer I like to get things done.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bst27/bst27/master/assets/welcome.png)

I'm a web developer who is passionate about driving the digital transformation,
creating convincing solutions and building solid, sustainable software.
Some technologies I enjoy working with include PHP and the TALL-Stack: Tailwind CSS,
Alpine.js, Laravel, Livewire.

I spend most of my time working on closed-source projects as a freelancer. Nevertheless, I
try to get deeper into open-source projects from time to time. You can explore
some results of this effort on my Github profile.
